# Changelog

## [5.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Real-Time Connection Resilience (+5 points in Offline Capability)
- **Visibility change reconnection** (+2 pts) — Detects `visibilitychange` event listener that triggers WebSocket/real-time reconnection when the page becomes visible again. Critical for mobile PWAs where backgrounding kills WebSocket connections.
- **Real-time reconnection strategy** (+2 pts) — Detects `reconnectionAttempts` configuration (should be high or `Infinity`) with progressive backoff (`reconnectionDelayMax`). Also checks for manual retry UI and `reconnect_failed` event handling.
- **Connection room re-subscribe** (+1 pt) — Detects persistent `connect` event listener that re-joins rooms/channels after reconnection, not just on initial connection. Without this, real-time events stop flowing after reconnection.

#### SPA State Persistence (+2 points in UX & Accessibility)
- **SPA view state persistence** (+2 pts) — Detects localStorage persistence of active view/tab/conversation IDs so users don't lose their position when navigating away and back. Includes graceful handling of stale IDs (e.g., 404 responses for deleted resources).

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 185 to 192 points**
- Offline Capability: 19 → 24 points
- UX & Accessibility: 27 → 29 points
- Updated grading scale thresholds:
  - A+: 173+ points (90%+)
  - A: 154-172 points (80-89%)
  - B: 135-153 points (70-79%)
  - C: 116-134 points (60-69%)
  - D: 77-115 points (40-59%)
  - F: <77 points (<40%)

### Notes
Based on real-world PWA mobile UX bugs discovered during OryoNex production use:
- Mobile PWA users frequently switch between apps; WebSocket connections die silently with close code 1005
- Default socket.io config (5 reconnection attempts, 5s max delay) is exhausted in ~15 seconds — user may be away for hours
- After WebSocket reconnection, server-side room memberships are lost; events stop flowing unless rooms are re-joined
- SPA navigation (back button, gesture, tab switch) unmounts components and destroys state; users return to empty views
- These patterns are universal to any PWA with real-time features (chat, collaboration, notifications)

## [5.4.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### Service Worker & Caching Enhancements (+4 points)
- **Multiple caching strategies** (+2 pts) — Detects usage of different strategies (CacheFirst, NetworkFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate) for different resource types
- **Cache expiration config** (+1 pt) — Detects `maxEntries` or `maxAgeSeconds` for cache pruning
- **SW message handler** (+1 pt) — Detects `addEventListener('message', ...)` for client-SW communication

#### Offline Capability Enhancements (+2 points)
- **Background sync client trigger** (+1 pt) — Detects `registration.sync.register()` call when coming back online
- **Periodic sync registration** (+1 pt) — Detects `registration.periodicSync.register()` on app initialization

#### Performance Signals Enhancement (+1 point)
- **Network Information API usage** (+1 pt) — Detects `navigator.connection` for adaptive behavior on slow networks

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 178 to 185 points**
- Service Worker & Caching: 29 → 33 points
- Offline Capability: 17 → 19 points
- Performance Signals: 16 → 17 points
- Updated grading scale thresholds:
  - A+: 167+ points (90%+)
  - A: 148-166 points (80-89%)
  - B: 130-147 points (70-79%)
  - C: 111-129 points (60-69%)
  - D: 74-110 points (40-59%)
  - F: <74 points (<40%)

### Notes
Based on LookNex PWA deep dive analysis and real-world implementation gaps:
- Many PWAs have sync handlers in SW but never trigger sync from client
- Periodic sync requires explicit client-side registration with permission check
- Network Information API enables adaptive UX on 2G/3G/saveData connections
- Production PWAs need different caching strategies per resource type
- Cache expiration prevents unbounded storage growth

## [5.3.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### Offline Storage Enhancements (+3 points in Offline Capability)
- **Persistent storage request** (+1 pt) — Detects `navigator.storage.persist()` for iOS data persistence prevention
- **IndexedDB offline storage** (+1 pt) — Detects `indexedDB.open()` or `idb` library for structured offline data management
- **Storage quota monitoring** (+1 pt) — Detects `navigator.storage.estimate()` for storage health checks and warnings

#### Performance Optimizations (+2 points in Performance Signals)
- **Compression headers** (+1 pt) — Note about `Content-Encoding: gzip/br` verification via DevTools
- **Bundle chunking strategy** (+1 pt) — Detects `manualChunks`, vendor splitting, or runtime chunk patterns

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 173 to 178 points**

  - C: 107-124 points (60-69%)
  - D: 72-106 points (40-59%)
  - F: <72 points (<40%)

### Notes
Based on Flutter PWA optimization article and LookNex production implementation:
- `navigator.storage.persist()` prevents iOS from evicting PWA data after 7 days of inactivity
- IndexedDB enables offline storage for images, generation history, and complex data structures
- `navigator.storage.estimate()` helps warn users before storage quota is exceeded
- Gzip/Brotli compression can reduce bundle sizes by 60-80%
- Vendor chunking improves caching efficiency and parallel loading

## [5.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

#### Extended Theme Pattern Checks (+5 points in UX & Accessibility)
- **Dark overlay theme pairs** (+1 pt) — Detects `bg-black/X` patterns that need `dark:` prefix (e.g., `bg-white/60 dark:bg-black/60`)
- **Border visibility pairs** (+1 pt) — Detects `border-white/X` that needs light alternative (e.g., `border-zinc-200 dark:border-white/10`)
- **Hover state theme pairs** (+1 pt) — Detects hover backgrounds missing dual variants (e.g., `hover:bg-zinc-100 dark:hover:bg-white/10`)
- **Gradient theme support** (+1 pt) — Detects gradient stops without theme variants (e.g., `from-white/80 dark:from-black/80`)
- **Contextual text-white** (+1 pt) — Detects white text on non-colored/transparent backgrounds

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 168 to 173 points**
- UX & Accessibility: 22 → 27 points
- Updated grading scale thresholds:
  - A+: 156+ points (90%+)
  - A: 139-155 points (80-89%)
  - B: 122-138 points (70-79%)
  - C: 104-121 points (60-69%)
  - D: 70-103 points (40-59%)
  - F: <70 points (<40%)

### Notes
These additions are based on real-world theme issues discovered during LookNex PWA production testing:
- `bg-black/60` overlays invisible/wrong in light mode
- `border-white/10` borders invisible in light mode
- `hover:bg-black/10` hover states not visible in light mode
- `from-black/80` gradients incorrect in light mode
- `text-white` on transparent overlays unreadable in light mode

Alpha/opacity colors are commonly used for dark mode but require explicit light mode counterparts.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

#### Mobile Dropdown Positioning (+3 points in UX & Accessibility)
- **Mobile dropdown positioning** (+2 pts) — Detects `fixed sm:absolute` pattern for dropdowns that break out of positioning context on mobile
- **Dropdown safe area handling** (+1 pt) — Detects `safe-area-inset-right/left` application for notch devices

#### Update State Management (+2 points in Offline Capability)
- **Update state persistence** (+1 pt) — Detects localStorage flags (e.g., `pwa-just-updated`) to prevent update prompt re-appearing immediately after update
- **Touch event double-fire prevention** (+1 pt) — Detects guards against duplicate execution from onClick + onTouchEnd

#### Theme Consistency (+2 points in UX & Accessibility)
- **Light/dark theme consistency** (+2 pts) — Verifies UI elements have both light and `dark:` variants in Tailwind CSS

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 161 to 168 points**
- Offline Capability: 12 → 14 points
- UX & Accessibility: 17 → 22 points

### Notes
These additions are based on real-world iOS PWA issues discovered during production app testing:
- Dropdown positioning with `absolute` relative to narrow containers causes viewport overflow on mobile
- Update prompts re-appearing after user clicks "Update" due to missing state persistence
- Hardcoded dark colors appearing incorrectly in light theme

---

## [5.0.2] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Notification action buttons** (+1 pt) — Detects push notifications with actionable buttons (`actions` array) or `event.action` handling in notificationclick. Enables richer user interactions directly from notifications.

### Changed
- **Total scoring increased from 160 to 161 points**
- Service Worker & Caching: 28 → 29 points

---

## [5.0.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **cursor: pointer best practice** — Added to Touch Events & Interactions section. iOS Safari requires `cursor: pointer` CSS on interactive elements to recognize them as clickable. Without this, click/touch events may not fire reliably in PWA mode.

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

#### iOS Safe Area Support (+4 points in UX & Accessibility)
- **viewport-fit=cover check** (+2 pts) — Required for iPhone notch/Dynamic Island safe area access

#### iOS Splash Screens (+2 points in Advanced Manifest)
- **apple-touch-startup-image detection** (+2 pts) — iOS requires separate splash images for each device size

#### Touch Event Handling (+1 point in UX & Accessibility)
- **Touch event handlers** (+1 pt) — Detects `onTouchEnd` handlers and `touch-manipulation` CSS for iOS compatibility

#### Update UX (+2 points in Offline Capability)

- **Graceful update flow** (+1 pt) — Detects user-controlled update implementation

#### iOS Compatibility Bonus (+1 point, new category)
- **Complete iOS meta tag set** (+1 pt) — Bonus for having all iOS-specific meta tags

#### Enhanced iOS/Safari Documentation
- Comprehensive safe area handling guidance
- Touch event best practices for iOS PWA mode
- Splash screen requirements and media query patterns
- **backdrop-filter stacking context warning** — iOS Safari creates isolated stacking contexts for elements with backdrop-blur, causing z-index issues. Solution: use `transform: translate3d(0,0,0)` to force GPU layer

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Total scoring increased from 150 to **160 points**
- UX & Accessibility: 12 → 17 points
- Advanced Manifest: 13 → 15 points
- Offline Capability: 10 → 12 points
- Added new Category 11: iOS Compatibility (1 point bonus)
- Updated grading scale thresholds:
  - A+: 144+ points (90%+)
  - A: 128-143 points (80-89%)
  - B: 112-127 points (70-79%)
  - C: 96-111 points (60-69%)
  - D: 64-95 points (40-59%)
  - F: <64 points (<40%)
- Expanded iOS/Safari limitations section with practical implementation guidance
- Added warnings for missing safe area handling and iOS splash screens

### Why This Version

This release focuses on iOS and mobile compatibility, addressing real-world issues discovered during PWA development:

1. **iPhone Notch/Dynamic Island**: Without proper safe area handling, content is obscured in PWA mode
2. **Touch Events**: `onClick` handlers don't always fire on iOS PWAs — `onTouchEnd` is essential
3. **Splash Screens**: iOS shows blank white screen without proper startup images
4. **Update UX**: Users should be notified of updates and control when they're applied

These checks ensure PWAs work correctly on iPhones, which represent a significant portion of mobile users.
